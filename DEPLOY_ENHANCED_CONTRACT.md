# üöÄ Deploy Enhanced Contract with Rewards

## üîç **Problem Diagnosis**

The current contract at `0xe8Cd3EFc8F93DA34fe22E8c9e8c517296cf05F8A` appears to be the **old version** without reward functionality. This is why transactions are failing - the `recordVerifiedPose` function doesn't exist in the deployed contract.

## üìã **Solution: Deploy Enhanced Contract**

### **Step 1: Verify Current Contract Issue**

1. Open `contract-verification-tool.html` in your browser
2. Click through all the verification steps
3. This will confirm that the deployed contract lacks reward functions

### **Step 2: Deploy Enhanced Contract Using Remix IDE**

#### **2.1 Open Remix IDE**
1. Go to https://remix.ethereum.org/
2. Create a new file: `RhythmPoseProof.sol`

#### **2.2 Copy Enhanced Contract Code**
Copy the complete code from `contracts/RhythmPoseProof.sol` into Remix.

#### **2.3 Compile Contract**
1. Go to "Solidity Compiler" tab
2. Select compiler version: `0.8.0` or higher
3. Click "Compile RhythmPoseProof.sol"
4. Ensure no compilation errors

#### **2.4 Deploy to Sonic Blaze Testnet**
1. Go to "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab
2. **Environment**: Select "Injected Provider - MetaMask"
3. **Network**: Ensure MetaMask is on Sonic Blaze Testnet
   - Chain ID: 57054
   - RPC: https://rpc.blaze.soniclabs.com
4. **Contract**: Select "RhythmPoseProof"
5. Click **"Deploy"**
6. Confirm transaction in MetaMask
7. **Copy the new contract address** from the deployment result

### **Step 3: Update Application Configuration**

#### **3.1 Update Contract Address**
Edit `js/smart-contract-integration.js` line 15:

```javascript
// Replace this:
address: "0xe8Cd3EFc8F93DA34fe22E8c9e8c517296cf05F8A",

// With your new contract address:
address: "YOUR_NEW_CONTRACT_ADDRESS",
```

#### **3.2 Update ABI (if needed)**
The ABI in your application should already match the enhanced contract. If you encounter issues, replace the ABI in `smart-contract-integration.js` with the ABI from Remix after compilation.

### **Step 4: Fund the New Contract**

1. **Send S tokens** to your new contract address
2. **Recommended amount**: 1-5 S tokens
3. **Use MetaMask** to send the transaction

### **Step 5: Test the Enhanced Contract**

#### **5.1 Quick Test**
1. Open `test-contract-functions.html`
2. Update the `contractAddress` variable with your new address
3. Run all tests to verify functionality

#### **5.2 Full Application Test**
1. Refresh your main application
2. Connect wallet
3. Initialize zkTLS
4. Perform pose and generate proof
5. Should receive 0.01 S reward automatically!

## üõ†Ô∏è **Alternative: Quick Fix for Current Contract**

If you prefer to keep using the existing contract without rewards:

### **Option A: Disable Rewards, Keep Functionality**

Edit `js/smart-contract-integration.js`:

```javascript
// In recordVerifiedPose function, replace the call with:
const transaction = await this.contract.methods.recordPose(
    poseData.poseName,
    poseType,
    poseData.score,
    poseData.duration
).send({
    from: this.userAccount,
    gas: 300000
});

// Remove reward-related code
console.log('‚úÖ Pose recorded (no reward):', transaction.transactionHash);
```

### **Option B: Manual Reward System**

Create a separate reward mechanism outside the smart contract:

1. Track successful proofs in local storage
2. Manually send rewards from a funded wallet
3. Use a centralized reward distribution system

## üìä **Recommended Approach**

**Deploy the enhanced contract** for the best user experience:

‚úÖ **Pros:**
- Automatic 0.01 S rewards
- Transparent on-chain tracking
- Better user engagement
- Future-proof functionality

‚ùå **Cons:**
- Requires new deployment
- Need to update contract address
- Must fund new contract

## üîß **Deployment Checklist**

- [ ] Verify current contract issue using verification tool
- [ ] Compile enhanced contract in Remix IDE
- [ ] Deploy to Sonic Blaze Testnet
- [ ] Copy new contract address
- [ ] Update application configuration
- [ ] Fund new contract with S tokens
- [ ] Test reward functionality
- [ ] Update documentation with new address

## üéØ **Expected Results After Deployment**

After successful deployment and configuration:

1. **Contract verification tool** shows all functions available
2. **Gas estimation** succeeds for both functions
3. **Transactions execute** successfully without reverts
4. **Users receive** 0.01 S rewards automatically
5. **Beautiful notifications** appear for rewards

## üÜò **Need Help?**

If you encounter issues during deployment:

1. **Check Remix console** for compilation errors
2. **Verify network** is Sonic Blaze Testnet
3. **Ensure sufficient gas** for deployment (usually 2-3M gas)
4. **Confirm MetaMask** has enough S tokens for gas fees
5. **Use verification tool** to test the new contract

The enhanced contract deployment will solve the EVM revert issues and enable the automatic reward system as intended!
